            <p>This project was submitted to 2020 CHI Game Design Competition in form of a 2-minutes game trailer, a 2-minutes gameplay demo and a research paper with deails of the design porcess, devleopment process and literature review. We chose one of the prompts: to expand the boundaries of the gampley and explore the role of game/gamification in a non-game setting such as medical, education, sustainability, etc.
                Climate change has always been an issue that people are concerned about. Evidence shown that climate change is happening: glacial retreat, rising temperature, increase of carbon dioxide level, etc. Many people consider climate change as an urgent crists and take actions to preserve our environment, however some people think climate change is a distant issue that's not relevant to them.<br><br><br></p>

            <h2 class="peoplep-heading-2">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p><br>We began with studying the existed game or gamification related to sustainability.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ant Forest: Ant Forest is one of most successful green gamification apps. When the app launched, it attracted over 500 million users. When the users took actions to reduce emission, they are rewarded with points that can grow a virtual tree which the app will then plant a real treein desertificated land. Most users have positive feedbacks on the app, stating it is easy to play and it makes them feel a sense of achievenment.</li>
                    <li>JouleBug: Users compete with their friends by lowering energy bills and reducing waste and share their stories on social media. Users can also track their impacts made on the environment. It is free and easy to play but some people prefer to complete task individually instead of competing with others.</li>
                    <li>WWF Free Rivers: This is an augemented relatity game that users can immerse themselves in a virtual village and learn how animals and people depend on rivers. Users like the innovative idea of this interactive game however the game still needs more development due to the technological instability.</li>
                    <li>EcoDice: Users interact with a virtual dice with different tasks on each face of the dice. The tasks are easy to execute which make it a good learning tool for children. However, the tasks become repetitive after playing it for a while.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <img src="images/peoplep-competitive-analysis.png" alt="">   
            <h2 class="peoplep-heading-2">Literature Review</h2>
            <p><br>Our research topic focused on how to motivate pro-environmental behavior that consciously looks for way to reduce negative impact on the environment and how persuasive technology, meaning using technology to change people’s behavior in some way, plays a role in green gam/gamification. The research provided us with some new insights:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emotion engagement is the key for behavioral changing. Some of the emotions include: moral, guilt, proud, and sense of achievement.</li>
                    <li>Strengthening environmental self-identity(people who consider themselves as type of people who act eco-friendly) is an effective way to promote pro-environmental actions.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><br>There are several factors that would change people’s behavior, but most important factor is emotion. When a story, an experience or a visual resonates with people, people are likely to be intrinsically motivated to take actions or change behaviors.</p>

        <div class="peoplep-game-design">
            <h1 class="peoplep-heading"><br>Game Design</h1>
            <p>Based on the literature review and user interviews, we decided to deliver a story based interactive game that could trigger player’s emotions by immersing them in a narrative experience, interacting with the game characters, and witnessing the change of environment through a complete timeline. Inspired by the New York Times article about Tuyuksu glacier in Central Asia, we created a story about the main character traveling back to time to discover reasons behind the suffering of the Almaty city, the biggest city of Kazakhstan. </p>
        
            <h2 class="peoplep-heading-2"><br>Story Design</h2>
            <p><br>In the New York Times article, scientists provided two important years where cities near the Tuyuksu glacier will face big challenges. One of years is 2025. Due to the glacial retreat, the sudden increase of the melting water will lead to flooding for some areas. Another year is 2050. A lot of cities close to the glacier depend on it for water supply, if there is no more melting water on the glacier the cities will encounter water shortage. Based on these two predictions and times provided, we generated other time points to complete the timeline.</p> 
            <img src="images/storydesign.png" alt="">   
            <h2 class="peoplep-heading-2">Game Development</h2>
            <p><br>As a story-based game, we decided to use cutscene animation to present the background story as well as the interaction between characters, and low-poly style minigames in between for players to interact with.
                Each cutscene was hand-drawn digitally. Some scenes and characters are designed based on online resources. Importing into After Effect, I used simulation provided to imitate natural elements such as fire and 3D layer to make simple object movements. Conversations were also added to make the characters more lively. After the cutscenes were made, total of 15 scenes were then connected with transition and music using Adobe Premiere Pro to make a complete trailer.
